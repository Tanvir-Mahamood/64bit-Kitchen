# Online Restaurant and Food Delivery Website

## Overview
This project aims to create a comprehensive online platform for a restaurant, enabling customers to browse, order, and track their food deliveries. 
The platform also provides an administrative panel for managing the restaurant's operations, including menu items, orders, and user interactions. 
The website has two main interfaces: the User Panel and the Admin Panel, each with distinct functionalities to ensure seamless interaction between users and administrators. 

The project is built using PHP with [PDO](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) for secure and flexible database interactions. Additionally, it includes an advanced query system, allowing admins to retrieve specific data dynamically, and PDF generation using [Dompdf](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/releases) for exporting query results.
